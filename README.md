## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **PHP 8.1+** with extensions: BCMath, Ctype, cURL, DOM, Fileinfo, JSON, Mbstring, OpenSSL, PDO, Tokenizer, XML
- **Composer** (PHP package manager)
- **Node.js 16+** & NPM (for frontend assets)
- **MySQL 5.7+** or **MariaDB 10.3+**
- **Redis** (recommended for queue and caching)

### 🛠 Installation Guide

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aayat-aslam/bulk-import-chunck-upload.git
cd bulk-import-chunck-upload
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install PHP dependencies
composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install
```

#### 3. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Generate application key
php artisan key:generate
```

#### 4. Database Setup
1. Create a new MySQL database
2. Update `.env` with your database credentials:
   ```env
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
   DB_USERNAME=your_database_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   ```

3. Run migrations and seed the database:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate --seed
   ```

#### 5. Storage Configuration
```bash
# Create storage link
php artisan storage:link

# Set proper permissions
chmod -R 775 storage/
chmod -R 775 bootstrap/cache/
```

#### 6. Queue Configuration (Recommended)
Configure your `.env` to use Redis or database queues:
```env
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis  # or 'database' if Redis is not available
```

Start the queue worker in a separate terminal:
```bash
php artisan queue:work --tries=3
```

#### 7. Start Development Servers
In separate terminal windows:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend server
php artisan serve

# Terminal 2: Frontend assets (Vite)
npm run dev

# Terminal 3: Queue worker (if using queues)
php artisan queue:work
```

#### 8. Access the Application
- Web Interface: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- API Base URL: [http://localhost:8000/api](http://localhost:8000/api)

Default Admin Credentials:
- Email: admin@example.com
